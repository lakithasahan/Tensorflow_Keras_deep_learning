# Tensorflow_Keras_deep_learning
In this example we use Keras deep learning library to classify  famous IRIS data set. You can download the complete code with data set from download section.

**Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.**

## Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

    1) Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
    2) Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
    3) Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
